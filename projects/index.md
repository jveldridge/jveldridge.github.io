From Fall 2009 - Winter 2012, most of my development energy went into working on a new grading
system for CS courses at Brown called cakehat. The motivating philosophy behind cakehat is that
while being a TA is great, grading is not. The goal of cakehat is to make this least fun part of
the job as streamlined, effective, and painless as possible.

Cakehat is written in Java and has grown to nearly 40,000 lines of code.  You can take a
look at the project on our Google Code site: [cakehat.googlecode.com](http://cakehat.googlecode.com).

###Siliclone

Siliclone, written with Tristan de Rond, Noah Langowitz, and Douglas Hall, was my final project for
CS 32: Introduction to Software Engineering. Siliclone is a "circuit simulator for molecular
biologists" that seeks to provide an intuitive visual interface for creating workflows simulating
multi-stage molecular biology experiments.

Siliclone is written in Java using the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). You can take a look at the project
on our Google Code site: [siliclone.googlecode.com](http://siliclone.googlecode.com).
