#About me

<img src="/assets/face.gif" align="right" style="width: 150px; margin-left: 20px"/>

I am currently a master's student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.brown.edu) at [Brown University](http://www.brown.edu). I do research as part of [Raphael Lab](http://compbio.cs.brown.edu) in the CS department and the [Center for Computational Molecular Biology](http://www.brown.edu/Research/CCMB/index.htm).

I also studied at Brown as an undergraduate, graduating in 2011 with degrees in Computer Science and Science & Society.  From 2011 - 2013, I worked at Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, WA.  During my time there, I was a Program Manager on the Windows Live Engineering Platform and Windows Developer Experience teams.

In my free time, I like to play the violin, read books, and get super-competitive at board games.
