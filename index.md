#About me

<img src="/assets/face.gif" align="right" style="width: 150px"/>

I am a Program Manager on the Windows Developer Experience Runtime Experience team at Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, WA.  I previously worked on the Windows Live Engineering Platform Customer and Monetization Experience team.

I graduated in 2011 from Brown University with degrees from the Department of Computer Science and the Program in Science and Society.  My particular interests are in Computational Biology and History of Science.

I also like to play the violin, read books, and get super-competitive at board games.
